# plotly_chart

## Project Overview
Roza has a partially completed dashboard that she needs to finish. She has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

## Resources
- Sofware: Visual Studio Code
- Language: JavaSript
- Language: HTML
- Library: Plotly
- Library: Bootstrap CSS style

## Deliverable 1: Create the horizontal bar chart to display top 10
We created the bar chart and set to horizontal orientation for the top 10 bacteria counts. The yticks are the bacteria ids and when hovering you see the bacteria name as well.

## Deliverable 2: Build a bubble chart to show the bacteria cultures per sample
With the bubble chart created, we then had to work to add chart title, xasis title and colour scheme for the bubbles.

## Deliverable 3: Gauge chart to show frequency of belly button washing
In order for participants to quickly see how many times they wash, the gauge has multiple colours changing in increments of 2 on the scale from 0 - 10.

## Deliverable 4: Customize the Dashboard

## Summary
Putting all these charts together and ensuring they were interactive with the drop-down selection was challenging but the result is a webpage that looks good and will allow volunteers to quickly get the results of their samples once they are tested.
